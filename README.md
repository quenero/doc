## What Is Quenero?

***Quenero*** is a masternode coin which encourages daemon running QMR to be rewarded apart from mining . Miners have their own reward and so does running Quenero as masternode. Masernodes are registered from the wallet. Masternode encourages more people to run quenero as daemon. Quenero development will basically follow Monero implementations and will build on any useful code implementations. Quenero is totally decentralized and it works completely like an known methods implemented by Monero. Its a privacy coin that encourages privacies of your transactions. Privacy is maintained by ring signatures and stealth addresses. Ring signatures ensures a sender to hide his or her own identity from other people. It is like keeping your bank transactions private. This is same as Monero and Oxen. Its a fair launch with no Premine.
