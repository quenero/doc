1.      Use of the QMR Wallet

The QMR Wallet app (hereinafter, referred to as the "App") allows the use of accessing the Quenero Blockchain/network. You are not authorized, and nor should you rely on the App for legal advice, business advice, or advice of any kind. You act at your own risk in reliance on the contents of the App. Should you make a decision to act or not act you should contact a licensed attorney in the relevant jurisdiction in which you want or need help. In no way are the owners of, or contributors to, the App responsible for the actions, decisions, or other behavior taken or not taken by you in reliance upon the App.

2.      Translations
The App may contain translations of the English version of the content available on the App. These translations are provided only as a convenience. In the event of any conflict between the English language version and the translated version, the English language version shall take precedence. If you notice any inconsistency, please report them on GitHub.

3.      Risks related to the use of the QMR Wallet.
The App, the Appâ€™s owner the Quenero Project and Quenero Project owners, partners, employees, contributors, and any affiliates will not be responsible for any losses, damages or claims arising from events falling within the scope of the following five categories:
1.      (1) Mistakes made by the user of any Quenero-related software or service, e.g., forgotten passwords, payments sent to wrong Quenero addresses, and accidental deletion of wallets.
2.      (2) Software problems of the App and/or any Quenero-related software or service, e.g., corrupted wallet file, incorrectly constructed transactions, unsafe cryptographic libraries, malware affecting the App and/or any Quenero-related software or service.
3.      (3) Technical failures in the hardware of the user of any Quenero-related software or service, e.g., data loss due to a faulty or damaged storage device.

5.      Compliance with tax obligations
The users of the App are solely responsible to determinate what, if any, taxes apply to their Quenero transactions. The owners of, or contributors to, the App are NOT responsible for determining the taxes that apply to Quenero transactions.
